On this page, you will find information about where you can ask your NBomber questions, discuss about NBomber and how you could contribute to the project.

## Questions and discussions

The community forum on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nbomber/community) is the primary support channel of the NBomber community. It’s the place to discuss features, recommendations and support type of questions.

Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=nbomber) to ask code-level questions or if you encountered a particular error. Start out by searching using the NBomber tag, and if you find no prior answers, just create a new question using the NBomber and load-testing tags.

## Feature requests and ideas

The community forum is a great place for discussions. Open a conversation if you want to discuss a rough idea, features, architecture and best practices. If you already have a well-formulated idea of your feature request, we recommend filing a [new issue](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber/issues), if there isn’t an open one already.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in NBomber, create an [issue](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber/issues). Please search that it hasn’t previously reported. If you have found a bug on this documentation site, please let us know in the channel on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nbomber/community).
