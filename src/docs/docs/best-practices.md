## What to measure about performance

People usually think about performance wrong, resulting in asking wrong questions like can your server handle 10K connections or 2000000 users?.

…

What is important to remember: Performance is a multidimensional characteristics. its impossible to make a picture of the system performance using only 1 metric.

When you asked about how good some stream of something is performing, you should think about:

    Throughput, Bandwidth
    Latency
    Response time
    Footprint

The relation between throughput and latency is described by Little’s law.
